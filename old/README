Welcome to BearFather's web admin panel.  
version 1.5

Inculded in this pack is a full admin panel with bash scripts that will 
control your server.  Even updates. 

It has support for dropbox backups, and will only keep 1 copy on there.
You do need to have it installed before installing this pack.

For updates you need to pack a rar with the following layout...
craftbukit.jar
plugins(directory)

The update process deletes this file and that directory.

Also I inculded a simple Rcon page (rcon.php), it using xPaws backend.
But you need to enable it in server.properties and change the password
info in MinecraftRcon.class.php
The servey query also uses xPaws backend for queries.

Enjoy.  

Any issues, bugs, or just plain bitching email me:
