1218 102211 elemento: session.minecraft.net is giving a 504.   I think that's the issue.
0237 102311 bearfather: yeah If you hit enter it will send it to the oppsite mode, so in admin chat it sends it to console, in console it sends it to admin.
0238 102311 bearfather: Its a bug in html.  When enter is sent it uses the first form button action.  Which on this page is the other mode.
1036 102511 cypher1024: Ahh. Good to know!
1206 110511 zok: Hey folks?
1207 110511 zok: Haha, hail citizens.
0301 110611 cypher1024: I'm not sure what is happening, but I like it!
0158 111211 bearfather: woohoo fixed the enter bug...you now can hit enter to send your message
0333 111211 bearfather: also check the control tab, it has new options
0854 111811 zok: Hey cypher, what's your BF3 name??
0155 112411 cypher1024: cypher1024 - very original I know :p
0156 112411 cypher1024: I'm not very good though. The best strategy is probably to be on the other team.
0317 112511 zok: Hah, nonsense! I'm down with coop too if that's your bag =)
1220 112711 cypher1024: I wish I'd asked you guys about co-op a few days ago. I've been playing with randoms and it's been nothing but pain.
1221 112711 cypher1024: I've got all the unlocks, but I'm happy to help you get yours if you'd like!
0312 112911 zok: I enjoy score chasing and the missions are entertaining enough =)
1123 113011 cypher1024: I've seen that! You're at the top of  my leaderboards for most (if not all) of the co-op missions.
0914 120711 : sd
0916 120711 bearfather: test
0744 120911 cypher1024: oh cool! the admin chat loads automagically now! Nice work man!
0332 121711 zok: Thanks! I've just got two left to top ^_^
1252 121811 cypher1024: :D Have you managed to get a flawless run through Drop 'Em Like Liquid yet? I heard there's some medal you get.
0108 121811 cypher1024: Bear - some kid called 'venback' keeps begging to be upgraded, even though he's only been around for a day or two and doesn't seem to spend any decent amount of time online. Please don't upgrade him if he asks.
0201 122311 bearfather: no prob.  Hes been banned!
1249 122911 elemento: cypher did it
1252 122911 cypher1024: Uhh... I think I screwed up. I was trying to make an 18x36x1 slab, but I think I didn't set one of the points right, so it's trying to fill a giant area instead... Hopefully we aren't locked out for too long. 
0103 122911 cypher1024: This is why we can't have nice things :(
0104 122911 cypher1024: This is why we can't have nice things :(
1239 022512 bearfather: This is a test line
